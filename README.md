- Developed and conducted research on Heart Disease Prediction using various machine learning 
techniques to forecast heart disease based on the 13 attributes from the UCI repository dataset.

- Implemented thorough data preprocessing, feature selection and model training utilizing algorithms 
such as Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest, Naïve Bayes, SVM and Decision Tree.

- Demonstrated strong analytical skills through EDA, data visualizations and accurate model 
evaluation. I was able to enhance the model accuracy to (90%) compared to previous research papers
by performing hyperparameter tuning focusing on the random state in the Random Forest technique.

Technologies and Future Work:

Utilized Python, scikit-learn, and other relevant tools for implementation.
Emphasized the importance of continuous improvement, suggesting future enhancements for the project.
